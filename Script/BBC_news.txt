From the host application console output, it is clear that the FPGA accelerated kernel can outperform CPU-only implementation by a factor of 68x.
It is a large gain in terms of performance over CPU.
The following labs will illustrate how this performance allows processing more than three HD video channels with 1080p resolution in parallel.
The tutorial describes how to achieve such performance gains by building a kernel and host application written in C++.
The host application uses OpenCLâ„¢ APIs and Xilinx Runtime (XRT) underneath it, demonstrating how to unleash this custom-built hardware kernel's computing power effectively.
